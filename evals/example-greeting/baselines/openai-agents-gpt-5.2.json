I’m reaching out about…”\n\n- **Be careful with time-of-day greetings**\n  - “Good morning/afternoon” can be nice, but time zones can make it awkward. “Hello/Hi” is safer for global email.\n\n- **Avoid filler or overly familiar language**\n  - “Hope this finds you well” is common; consider varying it or skipping it.\n  - Don’t use pet names (“Hi friend,”) unless you truly have that relationship.\n\n- **Use punctuation and formatting that reads professional**\n  - Comma is standard: “Hi Maria,”\n  - Keep exclamation points minimal (often 0–1).\n\n- **If it’s a follow-up thread, acknowledge continuity**\n  - “Hi Dana—thanks for the update.” / “Hi all—following up on the timeline.”\n\n- **When delivering bad news or urgent requests, be direct but polite**\n  - “Hello Chris—quick note on the issue we found…” beats a long pleasantry.\n\nIf you tell me the scenario (job application, customer support, internal update, cold outreach) and the level of formality you want, I can suggest a few greeting options tailored to it.",
