Exclamation points can feel overly enthusiastic if overused.\n- **When in doubt, default to polite and simple:** “Hello [Name],” is rarely wrong.\n\nWarm regards!",

            "output": "**Best practices for greeting messages in emails**\n\n- **Match the formality to the relationship and context**\n  - Formal: “Dear Dr. Rivera,” / “Hello Ms. Chen,”  \n  - Neutral: “Hello Jordan,” / “Hi Priya,”  \n  - Casual (only if appropriate): “Hi Alex,” / “Hey Sam,”\n\n- **Use the recipient’s name correctly**\n  - Double-check spelling, titles (Dr., Prof.), and preferred name.\n  - When unsure, choose a respectful default (e.g., “Hello [First Name]” or “Dear [Title] [Last Name]”).\n\n- **Choose a greeting that fits the time and geography cautiously**\n  - “Good morning/afternoon” is fine if you’re confident about time zone; otherwise “Hello” is safer.\n\n- **Open with a purpose-friendly first line**\n  - After the greeting, add one short sentence that sets context:  \n    “I’m reaching out about…” / “Thanks for your help with…”\n\n- **Keep it concise**\n  - Avoid overly long pleasantries before getting to the point, especially in business email.\n\n- **Be mindful with group emails**\n  - Use: “Hello everyone,” “Hi team,” “Hello all,” or “Dear committee members,”  \n  - For mixed seniority, neutral is safest: “Hello all,”\n\n- **Avoid overly casual or potentially awkward openers in professional settings**\n  - “Hey there,” “Yo,” “Hiya,” or pet names generally don’t fit workplace email.\n\n- **Use inclusive, culturally neutral language**\n  - “Hello” and “Hi” are widely acceptable; avoid assumptions about holidays, names, or honorifics.\n\n- **Consider the thread stage**\n  - First email: more formal.  \n  - Ongoing thread: you can shorten (“Hi Jordan,”) but stay consistent with tone.\n\n**Quick examples**\n- **Professional first contact:** “Hello Ms. Patel,”  \n- **Neutral coworker:** “Hi Chris,”  \n- **Group:** “Hello team,”  \n- **Customer/support:** “Hello Jordan—thanks for reaching out.”",
