Here are some key guidelines:\n\n## Professional Email Greetings\n\n**Formal Settings:**\n- \"Dear [Name],\" - Traditional and safe for most professional contexts\n- \"Dear Mr./Ms./Dr. [Last Name],\" - When you need extra formality\n- \"Dear Hiring Manager,\" or \"Dear [Department] Team,\" - When you don't know the recipient's name\n\n**Semi-Formal Settings:**\n- \"Hello [Name],\" - Friendly but professional\n- \"Hi [Name],\" - Warm and approachable for established relationships\n- \"Good morning/afternoon [Name],\" - Adds a personal touch\n\n**Key Best Practices:**\n\n1. **Match the tone to your relationship** - Use more formal greetings for first contacts, executives, or formal situations. Casual greetings work better with colleagues you know well.\n\n2. **Use the recipient's preferred name** - Pay attention to how they sign their emails. If they sign \"Bob,\" don't call them \"Robert.\"\n\n3. **Avoid overly casual openings in professional contexts** - \"Hey,\" \"Yo,\" or \"What's up\" are generally too informal for work emails.\n\n4. **Consider cultural context** - Some cultures expect more formality than others.\n\n5. **When in doubt, err on the side of formality** - You can always become more casual later, but starting too casually can create a poor impression.\n\n6. **Group emails** - Use \"Hello team,\" \"Hi everyone,\" or \"Dear colleagues,\" for multiple recipients.\n\n**Things to Avoid:**\n- \"To whom it may concern\" - Often seen as impersonal\n- \"Dear Sir/Madam\" - Outdated and generic\n- Misspelling the recipient's name - Double-check spelling\n- Generic greetings when you know the person's name\n\nWould you like more specific guidance for a particular type of email or professional situation?",
